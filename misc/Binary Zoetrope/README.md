## Files
[**data.zip**](./data.zip)

## Solution
- We are given with a zip which contains a lot of binary text files.
- Using the diff command, we can see that the consecutive files are almost similar with a few bits being changed & it tries to form a word.

```bash
git diff 0210.txt 0211.txt  --word-diff-regex=.
```

- Also the title says `Zoetrope`, which is a device that produces an illusion of motion from a rapid sequence of static images.
- The above 2 hints suggest that we need to combine all the text files in form of images to make a video/animation.
- Using the below python script, we create the `output.mp4` video.

## Flag
Seeing the video, we get the flag as the text scrolls from right to left.
